File handling in Python is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to perform a wide range of operations.
However, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of file handling when writing Python programs,
to ensure that the code is secure, reliable, and performs well.

In this article we will explore Python File Handling, Advantages, Disadvantages and How open,
write and append functions works in python file.
Python supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files,
along with many other file handling options, to operate on files.
The concept of file handling has stretched over various other languages, 
but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, like other concepts of Python, 
this concept here is also easy and short. Python treats files differently as text or binary and this is important. 
Each line of code includes a sequence of characters, and they form a text file. 
Each line of a file is terminated with a special character, called the EOL or End of Line characters like comma {,} 
or newline character. It ends the current line and tells the interpreter a new one has begun.
